            <p>Climate change mitigation consists of actions to limit global warming and its related effects. This involves reductions in human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) 
                as well as activities that reduce their concentration in the atmosphere.[2] It is one of the ways to respond to climate change, along with adaptation.[3]

                Fossil fuel combustion accounts for 89% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and 68% of all GHG emissions.
                 The most important challenge is to stop burning coal, oil, and gas and use only clean energy. Due to massive price drops, 
                wind power and solar photovoltaics (PV) are increasingly out-competing oil, gas and coal[5] though these require energy storage and improved electrical grids. 
                As low-emission energy is deployed at large scale, transport and heating can shift to these mostly electric sources.
                
                Mitigation of climate change may also be achieved by changes in agriculture, transport, forest-management (reforestation and preservation), waste management, 
                buildings, and 
                industrial systems. Methane emissions, which have a high short-term impact, can be targeted by reductions in cattle and meat consumption.
                
                Political and economical responses to date include forms of carbon pricing by carbon taxes and carbon emission trading, reductions of fossil fuel subsidies, 
                making national 
                promises and laws, subsidies, simplified regulations for the integration of low-carbon energy and divestment from fossil fuel finance.
                
                Almost all countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).[8] The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize atmospheric 
                concentrations of GHGs at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.[9] In 2010, Parties to the UNFCCC agreed that 
                future global warming should be limited to below 2 °C (3.6 °F) relative to the pre-industrial level.[10] With the Paris Agreement of 2015, this was confirmed.
                
                The current trajectory of global greenhouse gas emissions does not appear to be consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2 °C despite the 
                limit being economically beneficial globally and to many top GHG emitters such as China and India.
