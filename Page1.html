            <p id="Paragraph1">
                In the last 20 years, the rate at which Earth's glaciers are melting has nearly doubled! On average, the glaciers have lost 267 gigatonnes of ice per year. To put that into persepctive, a gigatonne is equivalent to 2.2 trillion pounds!
                According to NASA, sea level rose by about 3.6 millimeters, or 1.3 inches, per year for the past ten years. We also know that the average goes up with each passing year. The astronomical amount of greenhouse 
                gases produced by modern society are the main factor for the melting. The gases create the greenhouse effect, trapping heat in our planets lower atmosphere, raising the temperature as time goes on. Many 
                people do not think about the rising sea levels may impact us, so lets give some real live examples. In the United States, almost 40 percent of the population lives in coastal areas. Sea levels rising means 
                increased flooding and destruction of important infrastructure like roads, bridges, and subways. It also threates to destroy homes. Rising sea levels also cause storm surges to be more destructive. Terrible
                storms in recent memory include Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.
